Les MisÃ©rables (Highlights from the Motion Picture Soundtrack),11/1/2013,0,[FANTINE] There was a time when men were kind When their voices were soft And their words inviting There was a time when love was blind And the world was a song And the song was exciting There was a time Then it all went wrong  I dreamed a dream in time gone by When hope was high And life worth living I dreamed that love would never die I dreamed that God would be forgiving  Then I was young and unafraid And dreams were made and used and wasted There was no ransom to be paid No song unsung No wine untasted  But the tigers come at night With their voices soft as thunder As they tear your hope apart As they turn your dream to shame  He slept a summer by my side He filled my days with endless wonder He took my childhood in his stride But he was gone when autumn came And still I dream he'll come to me That we will live the years together But there are dreams that cannot be And there are storms we cannot weather  I had a dream my life would be So different from this hell I'm living So different now from what it seemed Now life has killed The dream I dreamed,21/12/2012,I Dreamed A Dream,Anne Hathaway

I'm redeeming you â€“ no you ain't I'm bad, and someone like that can't become a saint It's too ingrained â€“ He said, there's no one good â€“ you're goin' straight I took command, and I'm winnin' you back â€“ your soul is saved But, Lord, my past was awful, I feel so estranged I'm trapped â€“ Who trapped you? I don't see no ball and chain I laid hands on you â€“ you'll never do this alone again I guess you don't know the Lord's grace  Don't understand why they brought You myrrh But that's all right because I like Your day of birth Don't understand why You'd heal, me, Christ But that's all right because I lived the day You died I lived the day You died I lived the day You died  You know, they struck His body so much He could breathe when they hit Him But Jesus, He did not refuse, even though they whipped Him Not a warm, fuzzy feeling, gettin' killed just for livin' Like He's some punk they didn't know from Adam The Lord, He said, forgive 'em When they did those things to hurt Him Though they spit upon His face and invented stuff to curse and convict Him They plucked out his facial hair Laughed while givin' Him a thorny crown Pinned Him to a cross in the Roman mannerism Yet they gave Him a cold drink to cope with though Something infinitesimal, a gesture made Guess that they didn't know that in their painkilling recipe Something was left over from a different day One that came with frankincense and gold It was embalmer's myrrh Mixed with wine â€“ He still refrained You don't get it, Wonder Man, Christ was not immune to pain But it's not in vain Now the rest of us receive God's forgiveness Guess that's why they say ""no pain no gain""  Don't understand why they brought You myrrh But that's all right because I like Your day of birth Don't understand why You'd heal, me, Christ But that's all right because I lived the day You died I lived the day You died I lived the day You died  Now I know I said things, did things that were pretty mean And we fall back to the days of Adam and days of Eve But Your temptation was bad as mine is, from A to Z Yet You never flunked the test like I did You made it clean somehow They cussed at You, nailed You to a tree Maybe it was Satan just shiftin' the blame to You from me Maybe that's what happens when some fourth graders meet with Darth Vader All I know is the devil's too much for us to face now The Messiah picked up my tab 'cause He died for all Though I see sin starin' me in my face when I fall Though I'm just a slimeball Took me in when I called Yes, I'm enlistin' as a Christian disciple Guess it's time here for me to testify I will follow Christ even through my lowest times ""Cause I know I became righteous from the fact I know my Messiah If the devil tries to sucker me again I'm a try and do my best to just renounce that liar  Don't understand why they brought You myrrh But that's all right because I like Your day of birth Don't understand why You'd heal, me, Christ But that's all right because I lived the day You died I lived the day You died I lived the day You died",,Love The Way You Lie,Eminem Featuring Rihanna
